The project includes two visualizations:

Bar Chart: This chart visualizes the maximum mark achieved by any student in the dataset. It provides a clear comparison of each student's mark against the highest mark.

Donut Chart: This chart visualizes the lowest mark achieved by any student in the dataset. It offers a breakdown of how the lowest mark relates to the marks of other students.

How to View the Visualizations
